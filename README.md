# Taxonomist-Hackoona-Matata Submission

**Predict Tax Policy Success with Machine Learning**

Taxonomist is a machine learning-powered web application that helps policymakers and analysts evaluate the potential success of tax policies based on economic indicators.

**Disclaimer:** Since the dataset/features are still extending we have only depicted part of the solution and the idea . This is an long term project idea and in working. Thus, this isnt the final output

## üìú Model Overview  
The Taxonomist model is based on an **agentic approach**, dynamically linking tax policies, economic behavior, and socio-economic outcomes. The system simulates different agents, including **households, corporations, governments, and external sectors**, to predict GDP and policy effectiveness.
